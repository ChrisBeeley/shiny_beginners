## Sessions

* Three sessions of two hours
* Multi speed to cater for different skill levels
* Feel free to do some or all of the syllabus in each session
* I'll try to stay on after each session if you need any more help

## Session one

* What is Shiny?
* What does it do?
* Intro to reactivity
* *Application 1- minimal*
* Your first application
* *Application 2- Sitrep*
* Build a real application
* Reactive expressions
* Optional
    * NSE in Shiny applications
    * Bookmarks

## What is Shiny?

* Shiny is a web application programming framework
* It's a big sack of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, all called from R, basically
* It requires no knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, but if you have that knowledge it will do more

## What does Shiny do?

* It does this

```{r, echo = FALSE}

shinyAppDir(paste0(system.file(package = "shiny"), "/examples/01_hello/"))

```

## But it also does this

```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/monte_carlo.png")

```

## And this

```{r, out.width = "900px", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("figures/geoexplorer.png")

```

## How does Shiny work?

* Reactive programming
* When the inputs change, the outputs change
* Outputs *take a dependency on* inputs
* The Bad Old Days
* What you lose
* E.g. CRUD is hard
* You can control reactive dependencies

## One file, two file Shiny applications

* Back in the day Shiny apps were two files
* I'm going to teach you single file
* I don't love single file but that's the way the wind is blowing
* Either server.R and ui.R (defining server and UI)
* Or app.R with separate bits for server and UI
* UI- user interfacce
* Server- the guts. Graphs, data munging, etc.

## The fundamentals

* The fundamentals of Shiny apps are very simple
* You define a bunch of inputs using functions like textInput() and numericInput() in the UI
* Each input has a name
* You lay out your outputs in the UI using functions like textOutput() and plotOutput()
* Each output has a name
* Using the names you just defined in the UI, you define a bunch of outputs in the server using functions like renderPlot() and renderText()
* Within the server you can access the value of inputs using input$nameOfInput
* It makes a lot of sense if you just browse the code, which we will do now

## Let's make an app!

* File... 
* New... 
* Shiny web app... 
* Application name... 
* Single... 
* Choose directory

## We'll add a title to get warmed up

* Inputs are defined like this 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

textInput("nameOfInput", "Label for input")

```

* See ?textInput for more
* Add textInput(...) to the UI definition. In sidebarPanel()
* Inputs are referred to like this 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

input$nameOfInput

```

* And then add main = input$nameOfInput to the hist(...)

## The answer

UI

```{r, eval = FALSE}

sidebarPanel(
  sliderInput("bins",
              "Number of bins:",
              min = 1,
              max = 50,
              value = 30),
  textInput("titleInput", "Add a title")
),

```

Server

```{r, eval = FALSE}

hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', 
     border = 'white', main = input$titleInput)

```

## Now let's make an application from scratch!

* Demo **sitrep**

## Some code for you to use

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# at the top of the code file

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DT)

load("ShinyContactData.rda")

# UI

selectInput()

# server side

output$table <- renderDT({
  
  ShinyContactData %>% 
    filter(Year %in% input$year,
           Status %in% input$status) %>%
    group_by(Month, Group1) %>% 
    summarise(count = n()) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    spread(., Group1, count)
})

```

## Debugging

* Start simple
* Make sure your code works outside of Shiny!
* Use of cat()
* Breakpoints and browser()
* Run options(shiny.reactlog=TRUE)
* Run
* Press Ctrl+F3 for an interactive summary of reactive activity in your application
* This has saved me more than once
